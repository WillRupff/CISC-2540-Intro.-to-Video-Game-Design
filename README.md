# Lab 1: Hello Godot

This was my first experience using Godot. There is still much to learn, but I feel I am beginning to grasp the essential directions and skills needed for it.

I have two French bulldogs which is why I chose them as my sprites, and I liked the idea of a scene depicting one sleeping and one awake, one with the sun and one with moon, as one of my dogs is a night owl and the other is an early bird. 

I'm excited to explore more of Godot!
